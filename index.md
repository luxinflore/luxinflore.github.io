**Hi, I'm Aya!**

### _I explore real–world problems & design thoughtful solutions._

I'm a product thinker & creative who cares about how people and animals live, feel, & make decisions. I build thoughtful, user-centered products across software and hardware—from distributed systems to intuitive tools. I care deeply about impact, precision, and empathy in product development. 

Here you'll find product case studies, experimental projects, & ideas I can't stop thinking about.
