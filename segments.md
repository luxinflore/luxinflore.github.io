## Why Segments Matter‚Ä®
Breaking users into meaningful groups lets you:‚Ä®
* Empathize with distinct needs and behaviors.‚Ä®
* Discover underserved audiences.‚Ä®
* Prioritize roadmap investments based on impact.

## Segment Categories & Examples
Let's cover the most common, high-leverage dimensions¬†that product teams typically consider when segmenting users.‚Ä®Think of them as a¬†starting toolkit, or a menu of proven lenses you can mix and match depending on your product. Treat them as a solid foundation you adapt to your specific product and audience.

## Quick-Reference Scoring Table‚Ä®
Use this ready-to-fill table during workshops or planning session:  
[Google Sheet Template: User Segment Scoring Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EvuxWkeXJDdtvnv-HuwjaLi6QtMQKWMaNdqXC6rutIA/edit?usp=sharing)

It will look something like this:
![Segment Table](/assets/images/segment-table.png){: .img-sm }
Rate each dimension 1‚Äì5, then add or multiply to find a total score.  ‚Ä®
Higher scores indicate higher priority for design, research, and feature investment.

## Next Steps‚Ä®
1. Brainstorm potential segments (persona workshops, analytics clustering, interviews).  ‚Ä®
2. Fill out the table above.  ‚Ä®
3. Sort by total score and validate top candidates with qualitative research.

*Tip:* Revisit your segmentation quarterly or when market conditions change‚Äîsegments evolve as your product and users grow.
