## Segment Categories & Examples
Let's cover the most common, high-leverage dimensions¬†that product teams typically consider when segmenting users.‚Ä® Think of them as a¬†starting toolkit, or a menu of proven lenses you can mix and match depending on your product. Treat them as a solid foundation you adapt to your specific product and audience.

</div>

## Quick-Reference Scoring Table‚Ä®
Use this ready-to-fill table during workshops or planning session:  
[Google Sheet: User Segment Scoring Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EvuxWkeXJDdtvnv-HuwjaLi6QtMQKWMaNdqXC6rutIA/edit?usp=sharing)
(This may not properly render on mobile without the Google Sheets app)

It will look something like this:
![Segment Table](/assets/images/segment-table.png){: .img-fluid .img-lg .zoomable loading="lazy" }

Rate each dimension 1‚Äì5, then add or multiply to find a total score.  ‚Ä®
Higher scores indicate higher priority for design, research, and feature investment.

</div>

## Next Steps‚Ä®
1. Brainstorm potential segments (persona workshops, analytics clustering, interviews).  ‚Ä®
2. Fill out the table above.  ‚Ä®
3. Sort by total score and validate top candidates with qualitative research.

</div>

*Tip:* Revisit your segmentation quarterly or when market conditions change because user segments evolve as your product and users grow.
